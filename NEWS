Significant changes to the divest package are laid out below for each release.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.4.1

- Fixes for Solaris and OpenJPEG compatibility.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.4.0

- The data frame returned from scanDicom() can now be passed to readDicom(),
  and the latter gains a "subset" argument, which can be used to select a
  subset of the series to convert.
- The results of scanDicom() now also include the number of files associated
  with each series, and whether or not diffusion direction metadata is
  available.
- Additional attributes containing information about the acquisition are now
  extracted from the ASCII CSA header in Siemens EPI files.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.3.0

- A configure script has been added to detect OpenJPEG or JasPer libraries. If
  either is available, the package will be able to read DICOM data encoded
  using the JPEG2000 codec.
- The readDicom() function gains a "labelFormat" option, which allows the
  format of image labels to be customised.
- A new "verbosity" level of -1 is now supported, which filters all but warning
  and error messages from dcm2niix's output.
- Spurious date and time information should no longer be returned.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.2.0

- The readDicom() function is now interactive in suitable sessions, allowing
  the user to choose which DICOM series to convert.
- The new scanDicom() function allows the DICOM files in a directory to be
  scanned without performing any conversion. It returns a data frame
  containing information about the available scan series.
- Both functions now search the current working directory by default.
- Diffusion b-values and gradient vectors, and patient information, are now
  additionally stored as attributes in returned image objects.
- Image cropping and forced stacking options from dcm2niix are now exposed to
  the R interface.
- Gantry tilt correction is now applied to CT images where needed. (Reported
  by John Muschelli.)
- Phase encoding attributes are now handled more robustly.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.1.2

- The package now behaves correctly on big-endian systems.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.1.1

- A test has been made more robust.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.1.0

- First public release.
